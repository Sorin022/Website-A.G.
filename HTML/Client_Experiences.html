                            She is the absolute best, and she is really cool and awesome.</p>

                        <p>From the moment I met Audrey, I knew that I would be comfortable opening up to her without feeling judged or being embarrassed for what I was feeling. 
                            Audrey has helped me through some of the hardest times of my life and has helped a lot with my self-confidence and in me becoming the person I am now. 
                            Talking to her doesn't feel like I am with a therapist but more so a friend I know I can always confide in. 
                            I look forward to the time I spend with Audrey, even if I am going through an extremely hard time and find it hard to open up. Her office is an extremely comforting environment where I know I am always safe to be my true self. </p>

                        <p>I have been working with Dr. Gelfand for 6 years. The support she has given me is one of the reasons that I am where I am today. 
                            She has helped me greatly and I am truly grateful for her help.  
                            She always listened to what I had to say and never questioned the veracity of what I was saying. 
                            After, she would always have a way to help deal with the scenario at hand and never dismissed them as something meaningless. 
                            She is very good at what she does and I would recommend her to anyone that needs some help.</p>
